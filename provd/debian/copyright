         or its Contributor Version.
 .
 2.2. Effective Date
 .
      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
      effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
      such Contribution.
 .
 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
 .
      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
      License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
      or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
      2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
 .
      a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
 .
      b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
         modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
         Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
         Version); or
 .
      c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
         Contributions.
 .
      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
      logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
      notice requirements in Section 3.4).
 .
 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
 .
      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
      distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
      (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
      under the terms of Section 3.3).
 .
 2.5. Representation
 .
      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
      are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
      rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
 .
 2.6. Fair Use
 .
      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
      copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
 .
 2.7. Conditions
 .
      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
      Section 2.1.
 .
 .
 3. Responsibilities
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 .
      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
      terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
      of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
      they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
      restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 .
      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
      a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
         as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
         Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
         reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
         of distribution to the recipient; and
 .
      b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
         or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
         the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
         rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 .
      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
      Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
      with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
      Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
      You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
      such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
      their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
      either this License or such Secondary License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 .
      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
      copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
      of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
      Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
      required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 .
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
      of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
      warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
      alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
      jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 .
    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
    they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
    distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
    understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
      if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
      reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
      Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
      ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
      some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
      non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
      compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
      and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
      all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
      shall terminate.
 .
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
      termination shall survive termination.
 .
 6. Disclaimer of Warranty
 .
    Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
    warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
    without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
    merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
    risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
    Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
    Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
    correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
    License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
    except under this disclaimer.
 .
 7. Limitation of Liability
 .
    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
    party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
 .
 8. Litigation
 .
    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
    a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
    and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
    reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
    prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
 .
 9. Miscellaneous
 .
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
    contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
    this License against a Contributor.

 10. Versions of the License

 10.1. New Versions

       Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
       10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
       publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
       distinguishing version number.
 .
 10.2. Effect of New Versions
 .
       You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
       the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
       under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
       steward.
 .
 10.3. Modified Versions
 .
       If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
       create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
       version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
       references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
       modified license differs from this License).
