# How-to guides

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Ubuntu Desktop Provision, our
how-to guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied
to a broader set of applications. They’ll help you achieve an end result but
may require you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific
requirements.
